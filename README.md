## What is a computer virus?

A computer virus is a type of malware (malicious software) designed to make self-replicate, i.e. to make copies of itself on any drive connected to your computer.

Computer viruses are so-called because, like real viruses, they can self-replicate. Once your computer is infected with a virus, this is how it spreads. When a computer virus infects your computer, it may slow it down and stops it working properly.

There are three main ways that your computer may have become infected with a computer virus.

The first way your computer could become infected from removable media, like a USB stick. If you insert a USB stick or disk into your computer from an unknown source, it may contain a virus.

## How to protect your computer from viruses?

**_Here are some key ways that you can protect your computer from viruses:_**

* Use anti-virus software or a complete internet security solution, like Kaspersky Total Security. For your Android mobile, consider Kaspersky Internet Security for Android.
* Research apps and software by reading user reviews.
* Read developer descriptions before you download apps and software.
* Only download apps and software from trusted sites.
* Check how many downloads apps and software have. The more, the better.
* Check what permissions apps and software ask for. Are these reasonable?
* Never click on unverified links in spam emails, messages or unfamiliar websites.

* Use a secure VPN connection for public Wi-Fi, like Kaspersky Secure Connection.
* Never insert unknown USB sticks or disks into your computer.

## How does a virus get on your computer?

Computer viruses have been around for about as long as personal computers, and virus programmers understand that human error is always the easiest way to install a virus. Therefore, while strong antivirus programs can effectively prevent most computerized threats, they cannot stop a user from clicking the wrong link or installing compromised software on their own system. When you download programs or data from an unfamiliar site, remember that you may also be unknowingly accepting a viral program onto your system. Links in malicious emails can also start an automatic download.

And new viruses come online all the time. The experts at McAfee are constantly learning about new malicious programs and then developing solutions. If however, you do not regularly update your virus definitions, a harmful program may still be able to sneak by your defensive software.
